# Morpheus

My personal AI assistant overlord, designed to help with task management.

## How to run

Use `uv` like this:
```
uv run python morpheus.py
```

## Personalization

If you want to personalize Morpheus, you can create a `system_prompt.md` file in the same directory as `morpheus.py`. The contents of this file will be used as the system prompt for the AI model.
